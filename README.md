For this challenge, I have conducted a research project with Pewlett Hackard employee data. Pewlett Hackard had data for employees hired in the 1980s and 1990s stored on 6 CSV files. The project started with table creation for storing data from the CSV files. From there, I imported the CSV data into the SQL tables. After that, I used queries to pull and analyze data as requested by the customer. I used QuickDBD to make an Entity Relationship Diagram of the database tables. pgAdmin 4 was used in congunction with PostgreSQL to create the database and run queries.
